However, they do not harm animals, and in turn, animals do not harm them, even tamed creatures will disobey their master in the presence of a Druden. Unlike the typical demons, Druden cannot stand fire and will quickly ignite if exposed to it. They are known to also associate with a Demonic Noble known as Herne, also known as the Horned Huntsman, and join him in the Wild Hunt."
